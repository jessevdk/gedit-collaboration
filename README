gedit collaboration plugin provides support for collaborative editing in gedit.
It uses libinfinity 0.4 and should work with any infinote 0.4 server.

The plugin should compile for gedit stable (2.28), but a few features will
not be available. If you want those features, you will need
gtk+-2.18 and the latest gedit from git (nicer error reporting and showing
the file name in the tab label).

In addition, you will need to compile and install libinfinity from the
libinfinity-0.4 branch (git://git.0x539.de/git/infinote.git) because it
contains some bugfixes and API additions that are needed for the plugin.

Once installed and activated, you can use the side pane to view remote
servers with shared documents.

NOTE:
	* infinote 0.4 is not compatible with infinoted 0.3 or
	  sobby. You will need an infinoted 0.4 server to share
	  documents.

	* The current version needs the latest gtksourceview from git
