gedit collaboration plugin provides support for collaborative editing in gedit.
It uses libinfinity 0.4 and should work with any infinote 0.4 server.

The plugin should compile for gedit stable (2.28), but a few features will
not be available. At the moment, you will need the 'collaboration' branch
from http://github.com/jessevdk/gedit to enable all its features (nicer
error reporting and showing the file name in the tab label).

In addition, you will need to compile and install libinfinity from the
libinfinity-0.4 branch (git://git.0x539.de/git/infinote.git) because it
contains some bugfixes and API additions that are needed for the plugin.

Once installed and activated, you can use the side pane to view remote
servers with shared documents.
